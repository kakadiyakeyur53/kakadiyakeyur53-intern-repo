If QAs report a critical bug near the end of a sprint, how should it be handled?<br>
If QA reports a critical bug near the end of the Sprint, the first step is to identify the issue, assess its severity, and understand its business impact. Then, discuss it with the Product Owner to decide whether it can be fixed in the next iteration or must be addressed immediately.
<br>
If the risk is acceptable, mark it as high priority for the next Sprint and address it first in that cycle. If it must be fixed urgently, assign it to the most suitable developer—someone with the right skills, relevant code knowledge, availability, and capacity to handle the work. Once the fix is implemented, have QA test it promptly and ensure the QA process supports continuous testing to avoid similar last-minute issues in the future.

How can teams ensure that testing is not rushed or skipped due to tight deadlines?<br>
Parallel testing – Test features as soon as they are completed instead of waiting until the end of the Sprint.
<br>
Definition of Done (DoD) – Include “all required testing passed” as a non-negotiable part of completion criteria.
<br>
Automated testing – Use automated regression and smoke tests to speed up verification.
<br>
Buffer time – Reserve some team capacity for unpredictable bugs or last-minute issues.
<br>
Coding standards – Maintain high-quality code practices to reduce defect rates.

What strategies help reduce friction between Developers and QAs during bug triage?<br>
Focus on resolution, not blame – Keep discussions objective and solution-oriented.
<br>
Collaborative completion – Developers and QAs should work together to test and confirm a task before marking it “Done.”
<br>
Shared understanding of requirements – Agree on acceptance criteria and testing expectations before development starts to avoid rework.
<br>
Track recurring issues – Identify and address the root causes of frequent bugs to prevent repetition.
<br>
Preventive planning – Take precautionary measures to avoid known issues so time can be spent on new development rather than repeated fixes.

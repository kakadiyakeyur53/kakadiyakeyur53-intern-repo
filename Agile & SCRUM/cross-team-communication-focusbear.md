1. If Developers and QAs disagree on the severity of a bug, how should a Scrum Master handle it?<br>
When Developers and QAs disagree on a bug’s severity, the Scrum Master should bring both sides together to discuss the facts. Each party should present evidence — reproduction steps, business impact, possible solutions, and the root cause. To ensure everyone is aligned, the team should already have a clear severity definition in place that outlines what is considered critical, moderate, or acceptable. If there’s still disagreement, the Product Owner should join the discussion to provide the business perspective. Once all viewpoints are heard, the Scrum Master facilitates a decision and ensures the outcome is documented for future reference.

2. How can PMs and Developers align feature priorities without overloading the sprint?<br>
PMs and Developers should align priorities during collaborative Sprint Planning, using capacity-based planning informed by historical velocity and current team availability. Features should be selected based on a balance of value and effort, ensuring that the most valuable items are delivered within realistic limits. Work in progress should be limited so the team focuses on fully completing fewer items rather than starting many. A small capacity buffer about 10–15% should be reserved for urgent issues, ensuring that unplanned work doesn’t derail the Sprint.

3. What are the risks of not involving QAs early in the development process?<br>
If QAs are not involved early, defects are often discovered late in the cycle, making them more expensive and time-consuming to fix. Misunderstandings about acceptance criteria can cause rework, and without QA’s input, critical edge cases and usability issues may be missed. This leads to lower product quality and can create tension in the team, with QAs feeling sidelined and Developers facing last-minute changes. Early QA involvement ensures better collaboration, higher quality, and fewer late-stage surprises.

How do Scrum roles work together to ensure project success?<br>
Project success means delivering a real-world solution that meets expectations and solves the intended problem. To achieve this, the Scrum team must work together according to the agreed plan, with each role fulfilling its specific responsibilities:
<br>
Scrum Master – Responsible for managing the Scrum process, ensuring all requirements are met, removing blockers, and coaching the team to improve performance. They also coordinate communication between teams when there are multiple development groups.
<br>
Product Owner – The “heart” of the team, responsible for communicating with stakeholders, gathering requirements, planning work, and maintaining the product backlog to ensure smooth workflow.
<br>
Developers – The team members who build the product. They may work in one group or be split across multiple teams, but they collaborate closely with the Scrum Master and Product Owner to deliver the product increment.

How does a Product Manager’s role impact Sprint Planning and Backlog Prioritization?<br>
The Product Manager (or Product Owner) communicates with stakeholders to gather requirements. Based on these requirements, they manage available resources and design the product backlog.
<br>
Backlog Prioritization – The Product Manager decides the order of backlog items, giving priority to high-value or high-demand features that are important for the business.
<br>
Sprint Planning – Sprint planning is heavily influenced by the Product Manager’s requirements, as they set the context, clarify goals, and ensure the selected work aligns with business priorities.

If a developer is struggling to complete a task, whose responsibility is it to help unblock them?<br>
If a developer faces an issue, it is their first responsibility to attempt to resolve it themselves. If they cannot fix it, they should:
<br>
Seek help from colleagues, as Scrum teams are flexible and self-organizing.
<br>
If the issue remains unresolved, raise it in the Daily Standup.
<br>
The Scrum Master will then take responsibility for following up, discussing with team members, identifying the cause, and taking steps to resolve it.
<br>
If the issue still cannot be resolved, it can be escalated to the Product Owner, who may review past work, research solutions, or adjust the product backlog if necessary.
<br>
In short, the process starts with the developer, then moves to team collaboration, followed by the Scrum Master, and finally the Product Owner if needed

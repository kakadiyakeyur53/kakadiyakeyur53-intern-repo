If a customer reports a critical bug that must be fixed immediately, how should it be handled?<br>
When a customer reports a critical issue, first identify the severity of the problem, its impact on the business, and any associated risks. Once the details are clear, communicate them to the Product Owner for discussion and decision-making.
<br>
If it’s determined that the issue must be resolved immediately, assign it to the developer best suited to fix it quickly. After the fix is implemented, have a QA tester verify the changes promptly but thoroughly, ensuring no other functionality is broken.
<br>
Once resolved, document both the issue and the solution so the team can prevent similar problems in the future, and if they do occur, know how to resolve them quickly.

What are the risks of constantly interrupting sprint work for customer issues?<br>
If issues constantly interrupt Sprint work, there is a high risk of failing to meet Sprint Goals. Frequent disruptions can:
<br>
Reduce velocity and make delivery less predictable.
<br>
Cause context switching delays as developers move between planned work and urgent fixes.
<br>
Lower code quality, as rushed changes may introduce new bugs.
<br>
Lead to a more fragile codebase over time.
<br>
Demoralize the team, as they spend more time firefighting than building planned features.

How can Scrum Masters help teams avoid context switching fatigue while still addressing urgent issues?<br>
Addressing urgent issues is important, but Scrum Masters can minimize context switching fatigue by:
<br>
Rotating responsibility for handling urgent issues so it’s not always the same developer.
<br>
Allocating Sprint buffer time (e.g., 10–15% of capacity) for unplanned work.
<br>
Filtering by priority – only true high-severity (P0/P1) issues should interrupt the Sprint; others can be scheduled for the next Sprint.
<br>
Encouraging quick decision-making with the Product Owner to determine if an interruption is justified.

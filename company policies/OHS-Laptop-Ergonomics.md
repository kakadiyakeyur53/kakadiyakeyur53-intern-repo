I use a laptop stand to maintain proper posture, along with an external keyboard and mouse to enhance efficiency and comfort during work. 
I follow the 20-20-20 rule, which involves taking short breaks to rest my eyes and refresh my mind. This helps me stay motivated and consistently improve my work performance.

Here i am attaching images of my laptop setup and reminder task in focus bear application:

This setup makes it easier to work for long hours without discomfort, since I no longer have to bend over to use the laptop keyboard.

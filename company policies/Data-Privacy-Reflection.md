üõ†Ô∏è Task

1. Identify at least one habit or practice you can adopt to improve data security in your role:
As a Project Manager, access control is crucial. I will ensure that no unauthorized person has access to project resources and regularly audit team permissions. I‚Äôll also educate team members on the importance of secure handling of credentials and sensitive data.

2. Document at least one key learning or security measure you will implement:
I will enforce a thorough code review process to detect potential data vulnerabilities early. Ensuring all test cases meet security requirements will be a part of our standard QA checklist to minimize the risk of data breaches.

üìù Reflection
1. What steps can you take to ensure you handle data securely in your daily tasks?
Use secure and encrypted connections (e.g., HTTPS, VPN).
Avoid logging into or uploading data on unverified or unauthorized websites.
Do not integrate or link external services without proper research and validation.

2. How should you store, share, and dispose of sensitive information safely?
Store: Encrypt sensitive data such as passwords and personal details.
Share: Only with authorized personnel who require access. Use secure channels.
Dispose: Follow proper data disposal protocols, such as secure deletion or shredding (for physical documents).

3. What are some common mistakes that lead to data privacy issues, and how can they be avoided?
Uploading source code or sensitive files to public AI tools/websites. ‚Üí Avoid using such platforms unless verified safe.
Sharing credentials with team members casually. ‚Üí Use role-based access control and password managers.

üõ†Ô∏è Task

1. Identify at least one habit or practice you can adopt to improve data security in your role:
As a Project Manager, access control is crucial. I will ensure that no unauthorized person has access to project resources and regularly audit team permissions. I‚Äôll also educate team members on the importance of secure handling of credentials and sensitive data.

2. Document at least one key learning or security measure you will implement:
I will enforce a thorough code review process to detect potential data vulnerabilities early. Ensuring all test cases meet security requirements will be a part of our standard QA checklist to minimize the risk of data breaches.

Real-World Example: Verifying Access Request
Assume I receive a message from someone claiming to be a team member, asking for access to a restricted internal tool or resource. Since the resource is not publicly available, I would take the following steps to ensure security and follow Focus Bear's data privacy policy:

Verify Identity: First, I would check our internal team directory or contact list to confirm that the person is indeed a part of the team.
Check Authorization: Next, I would confirm their role and whether they are authorized to access the specific resource. I‚Äôd consider if the resource falls within their responsibilities and if they are trusted to handle it securely.
Seek Approval: If there is any doubt, or if the resource is sensitive, I would escalate the request to a higher authority (e.g., my team lead or security contact) to get approval before granting access.

This approach helps me avoid accidentally exposing sensitive information and aligns with our policies on access control and responsible data handling.

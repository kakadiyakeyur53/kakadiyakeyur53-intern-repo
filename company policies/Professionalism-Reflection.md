Have you ever experienced or witnessed great teamwork and professionalism? What made it effective?
Yes, in my previous role as a React Native Developer, I worked on a client project that was fully managed by our organization. As the deadline approached, one of our team members unexpectedly resigned, which caused a risk to our timeline. However, the entire team came together to cover that person's responsibilities. Thanks to this strong teamwork and collective effort, we were able to complete the project on time.

What steps can you take to make sure your communication is clear, respectful, and inclusive?
As a project manager, ensuring clear communication is one of my key responsibilities to minimize rework. Regular stand-up meetings help us quickly identify and resolve any miscommunication or blockers, keeping the team aligned and productive.

How can you prepare effectively for meetings with supervisors and colleagues?
For meetings such as sprint planning, daily stand-ups, and retrospectives, I will schedule them at fixed times based on team availability. Making these meetings compulsory ensures that we don’t miss any important updates or action points, keeping the team synchronized.

How might you follow up with colleagues or supervisors if you need information/action from them? How would you escalate it further if you don't get a response and when would you escalate?
If I need information or action from someone, I will first reach out formally. If there is no response, I will send a reminder. If I still don’t receive a reply, I will escalate the matter by involving a higher authority to prevent delays in the workflow.

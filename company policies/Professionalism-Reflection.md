Have you ever experienced or witnessed great teamwork and professionalism? What made it effective?
Yes, in my previous role as a React Native Developer, I worked on a client project that was fully managed by our organization. As the deadline approached, one of our team members unexpectedly resigned, which caused a risk to our timeline. However, the entire team came together to cover that person's responsibilities. Thanks to this strong teamwork and collective effort, we were able to complete the project on time.

What steps can you take to make sure your communication is clear, respectful, and inclusive?
As a project manager, ensuring clear communication is one of my key responsibilities to minimize rework. Regular stand-up meetings help us quickly identify and resolve any miscommunication or blockers, keeping the team aligned and productive.

How can you prepare effectively for meetings with supervisors and colleagues?
For meetings such as sprint planning, daily stand-ups, and retrospectives, I will schedule them at fixed times based on team availability. Making these meetings compulsory ensures that we don’t miss any important updates or action points, keeping the team synchronized.

How might you follow up with colleagues or supervisors if you need information/action from them? How would you escalate it further if you don't get a response and when would you escalate?
If I need information or action from someone, I will first reach out formally. If there is no response, I will send a reminder. If I still don’t receive a reply, I will escalate the matter by involving a higher authority to prevent delays in the workflow.

Respectful Communication in Remote Teams
In a remote team, especially one spread across multiple time zones, I prioritize clear, respectful, and inclusive communication. For example:
We currently use Discord as our main communication platform. I always ensure that critical conversations are documented and shared in the appropriate channels.
If a team member is in a different time zone, I respect their working hours and make use of asynchronous updates—either via recorded meetings or shared summaries—to keep them in the loop.
I regularly check in with quieter team members to ensure they feel heard and involved.


Creating a Positive & Inclusive Environment
Building a fun and supportive environment remotely takes effort, and I’m proactive about it:
I organize virtual get-togethers, such as weekly coffee chats or game sessions, to give people space to bond beyond work.
I celebrate small wins on team channels and recognize contributions openly.
I ensure everyone has a voice—even interns or junior team members—by actively inviting their opinions during meetings or async threads.


✅ Confirmation of Supervisor Guide & CEO Contact:
Yes, I have reviewed the supervisor guide and have noted the CEO’s contact number:
Jeremy Nagel – 0414 885 787

I understand that I should contact Jeremy in case of any emergency, serious issue, or situation requiring direction or escalation.

The use of AI in project management significantly boosts efficiency and enhances productivity. As a project manager, I often leverage AI during the story creation phase. Typically, I draft the initial story along with all relevant details, and then use AI to refine and enhance the content. This helps ensure the writing is clear, comprehensive, and easy for everyone to understand—minimizing the risk of miscommunication across the team.

In addition, AI can be highly effective in areas like KPI analysis and product performance evaluation, where it helps identify trends, insights, and opportunities for improvement much faster than manual methods.

Use of AI for Refactoring and Code Optimization:<br>
I primarily use ChatGPT to refactor my messages and make them more professional and understandable to a wider audience. I provide the core idea and draft, and ChatGPT helps me transform it into a polished version. Additionally, I rely on AI when coding to suggest better approaches, helping me optimize solutions without directly copying and pasting the code. I find this particularly useful when looking for efficient ways to structure my code.

Risks of Using AI in a Professional Context<br>
While AI provides immense value, there are inherent data privacy risks:<br>
•	There is a potential risk of data leakage or the inadvertent use of proprietary data for training purposes.<br>
•	AI-generated outputs may not always be accurate or aligned with our needs, and there is the risk of receiving false results when the AI fails to fully understand the context or requirements.<br>

Information That Should NEVER Be Entered into AI Tools<br>
To preserve privacy and protect sensitive information:<br>
•	Credentials (API keys, secret data, passwords) should never be shared with AI tools.<br>
•	I ensure confidentiality by only sharing non-sensitive, anonymized content to mitigate privacy risks.<br>

Fact-Checking and Validating AI-Generated Content<br>
I make it a point to validate all AI-generated content before using it:<br>
•	For messages, I review and refine the content generated by AI, ensuring it aligns with my understanding and professional tone.<br>
•	When using AI for code, I ask for suggestions rather than copying the full code. I incorporate those suggestions into my work, ensuring the solution follows best practices and fits the requirements.<br>

Personal Example of Relying on My Own Skills<br>
While I frequently rely on AI for refactoring and code suggestions, I still prefer to take the lead in situations where context and personal judgment are crucial. For instance, when I need to provide personal opinions or deal with complex tasks that AI can't perfectly address, I handle them myself to ensure accuracy and precision.

Task Improvement with AI<br>
One area where I’ve improved is my communication skills with AI. While AI helps me craft better messages, I always review its outputs to ensure they are accurate and aligned with my intent. This process enables me to verify authenticity and fine-tune responses before finalizing them.

Best Practice at Focus Bear<br>
At Focus Bear, I propose implementing a structured AI usage policy:<br>
•	Encourage team members to use AI tools for productivity improvements, especially in communication and coding.<br>
•	Emphasize precaution when using AI, particularly with sensitive data, to safeguard privacy and confidentiality.<br>
•	As a project manager, I will help develop clear guidelines for AI use, ensuring that all employees are aware of the risks and best practices.<br>

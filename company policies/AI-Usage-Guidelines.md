The use of AI in project management significantly boosts efficiency and enhances productivity. As a project manager, I often leverage AI during the story creation phase. Typically, I draft the initial story along with all relevant details, and then use AI to refine and enhance the content. This helps ensure the writing is clear, comprehensive, and easy for everyone to understandâ€”minimizing the risk of miscommunication across the team.

In addition, AI can be highly effective in areas like KPI analysis and product performance evaluation, where it helps identify trends, insights, and opportunities for improvement much faster than manual methods.

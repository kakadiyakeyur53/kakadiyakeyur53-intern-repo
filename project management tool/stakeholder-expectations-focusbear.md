If a stakeholder demands a last-minute change mid-sprint, how should a Scrum Master respond?<br>
If a stakeholder suggests a change, first listen carefully to understand what they want to convey and the ideas behind it. Then, explain the potential impact on the current sprint — both the challenges and the benefits.
If the change is not urgent, add it to the product backlog for the next sprint.
If it is urgent, consider replacing an existing task of similar size in the current sprint, prioritizing based on value.
Ensure that stakeholders, the Product Owner, and the development team all agree on the change so everyone is on the same page. Also, inform them that frequent changes during a sprint can affect progress and quality over time.

How can a Scrum Master communicate delays or roadblocks without causing frustration?<br>
A Scrum Master should communicate delays with complete information, while also presenting possible alternatives to keep the team moving forward. This helps prevent unnecessary waiting and frustration.
Address problems collaboratively, without blame, and inform all stakeholders as soon as delays occur so they are aware of the situation and can act accordingly. Use neutral, friendly language — the goal is to solve the problem, not to create tension.

What strategies help prevent unrealistic stakeholder expectations from derailing sprints?<br>
Use past sprint data to show how much work the team can realistically complete, and set sprint goals accordingly. Involve stakeholders in sprint planning so they understand the scope and expected outcomes.
A clear Definition of Done helps track progress accurately and reduces misunderstandings about what is included in a deliverable. Educate stakeholders on Agile principles — emphasizing incremental delivery rather than completing everything at once — and establish clear boundaries for handling scope changes.

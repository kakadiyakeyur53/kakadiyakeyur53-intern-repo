If the team realizes mid-sprint that they won’t finish all tasks, how should the Scrum Master respond?<br>
If the team realizes they are not able to meet the Sprint Goal, the Scrum Master should first identify the reason — for example, whether a single task is causing the delay. If that task is not critical and can be moved to the next Sprint, it should be replaced with another high-priority task that can be completed in time. If it cannot be replaced, the Scrum Master should identify other lower-priority tasks that can be moved to the next Sprint to free up capacity for the critical work. The Product Owner must be involved in these discussions, and all team members should be informed about any changes to the Sprint plan to ensure clear communication and alignment.

How can scope changes be assessed and communicated without disrupting sprint goals?<br>
When a new requirement arises or an existing requirement changes, the scope change should be assessed collaboratively by the Developers, Scrum Master, and Product Owner. If the new requirement is urgent, the team may swap it with an equivalent amount of current Sprint work to maintain balance. If it is not urgent, the change can be placed in the Product Backlog for prioritization in the next Sprint. The decision and reasoning should be clearly communicated to the entire team and stakeholders to maintain transparency.

What are the risks of micromanaging sprint tracking, and how can they be avoided?<br>
When Scrum Masters micromanage Sprint tracking, Developers may feel controlled rather than empowered. This can lead to frustration, reduced motivation, and wasted time on excessive reporting instead of focusing on delivery. It can also cause productivity drops due to constant context switching between development and status updates, ultimately affecting the Sprint’s velocity. To avoid this, the Scrum Master should only intervene when blockers arise or when issues are escalated, allowing the team to self-organize and work efficiently without unnecessary oversight.

Observation of Daily Standup at Focus Bear<br>
I attended the backend team’s standup meeting on Monday, 11/08/2025, at 4:00 PM. The standup was conducted online and hosted by Jeremy. All members joined, provided their updates, and discussed any questions they had.

Structure & Blocker Identification<br>
A digital platform was used for note-taking and attendance, which was efficient and reduced time spent on repetitive administrative work.<br>
During the meeting, some blockers were identified — for example, one team member was unsure how to proceed with a GitHub project, and this was resolved during the discussion.<br>
For my part, I needed certain access permissions to manage live work for the team. This was acknowledged, and Jeremy scheduled a separate meeting to address it.

Challenges & Areas for Improvement<br>
A consistent format for updates would improve clarity. Some members shared only their current tasks without mentioning their planned future work.

Overall, the meeting was well-structured, and notes along with minutes of the meeting were shared promptly with all participants, which was a good practice.

Reflection<br>
At Focus Bear, the backend team conducts daily standups at 4:00 PM online, hosted by Jeremy. The process is collaborative, blockers are addressed promptly, and follow-up actions are clearly defined. With a more standardized update format, the standups could become even more effective.

If you want, I can also rewrite this into a short, interview-ready answer so it reads like a crisp Agile reflection report. That way, you can use it directly in assessments or documentation.

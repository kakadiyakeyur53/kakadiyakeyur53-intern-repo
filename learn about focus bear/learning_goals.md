What do you hope to learn from this internship?
I hope to gain a deeper understanding of the Australian workplace culture and improve my ability to communicate effectively within a professional environment. I also aim to learn how teams collaborate in real-world projects here.

What skills are you most excited to develop?
I'm most excited to develop my communication and analytical skills. I believe these are essential for working efficiently in both technical and management roles, especially in cross-functional teams.

What do you think you can contribute to the team?
With my previous experience as a React Native developer and project manager, I bring a well-rounded perspective. I understand the needs and challenges of both development and management teams, which allows me to act as an effective bridge between the two and ensure smooth project execution.

What is one area you feel less confident in that you’d like to improve?
I sometimes find it challenging to prioritize tasks when multiple assignments have equal urgency. Through this internship, I’d like to improve my decision-making and prioritization skills under pressure.

What does success in this internship look like for you?
Success for me would be the ability to adapt to Australian work standards, contribute meaningfully to the product development process, and ultimately see the positive impact of our work on end users and the community.

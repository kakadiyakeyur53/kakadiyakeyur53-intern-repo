Why do you think Focus Bear was created?
Focus Bear was created to support individuals—particularly those with ADHD or autism—in maintaining focus and minimizing distractions while working. It provides structure and assistance in building healthy, productive routines.

What problem is Focus Bear solving?
Focus Bear addresses several key productivity challenges:
Blocking digital distractions (e.g., social media, games)
Helping users stick to a consistent morning routine
Boosting overall productivity through structured workflows
Enabling deep work by limiting access to non-essential apps during focus time

Why do you think this mission is important?
This mission is important because individuals with ADHD, autism, or even neurotypical people often struggle with attention and focus in today's distraction-heavy environment. With the rise of social media and digital overload, tools like Focus Bear play a critical role in helping users stay consistent, focused, and mentally balanced.

How does Focus Bear’s work align with your personal values or interests?
I’m passionate about contributing to meaningful projects that make a positive social impact—Focus Bear’s mission aligns closely with that. Additionally, I have experience in app development, especially using React Native, which is the technology used to build Focus Bear. From a project management perspective, my Master’s degree in Business and Management also enables me to effectively guide product development and contribute strategically to its growth.

Do you personally relate to any of the challenges that Focus Bear aims to solve?
While I haven’t faced ADHD or autism-related challenges myself, I recognize that social media distractions are common among today’s generation—including myself. Focus Bear’s ability to block distractions and use AI to maintain focus and consistency is a valuable solution that I personally support and see as widely beneficial.

I often find myself distracted by social media, especially Instagram, during study and work sessions. When studying, I tend to get bored, and having my mobile nearby leads me to check Instagram and Reels, where interesting videos keep me engaged for extended periods. Even when I decide to focus on work, notifications from messages often pull my attention away, compelling me to check them, which results in further distraction. Additionally, other notifications frequently trigger the urge to engage with social media, further consuming my time.

While I have not used any specific apps to limit my usage, I have taken advantage of a built-in feature on my mobile device that allows me to set limits on app usage. This feature reminds me when I’ve spent too much time on social media, encouraging me to refocus on my tasks. However, it does not fully prevent distractions.

I have found Focus Bear to be particularly useful, as it blocks apps and notifications, allowing me to concentrate on my work without interruptions.
